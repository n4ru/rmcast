VNSee-QTFB is a [VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) client for the [reMarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com) allowing you to use the device as a second screen or view a desktop environment running on your device. This is a fork of [VNSee](https://github.com/matteodelabre/vnsee) that has been ported to QTFB to enhance performance and compatibility, and has many new features and fixes.

## rm-cast (this fork)

This fork is the client half of [rm-cast](middleware/), an rMPP-side display-mirroring stack. The companion pieces live alongside:

- `middleware/` — xovi extension (`vncast.so`), qmldiff, qtfb shm protocol, and the cross-build script. Loads into xochitl, draws frames into a QML overlay, hooks the EPDC waveform path.
- [`n4ru/rewire`](https://github.com/n4ru/rewire) — Windows-side RFB server (DXGI capture, MONO1 1-bit luma encoding, pen injection).
- `patches/` — local patches applied against the vendored libvncserver submodule at build time (mono1 decoder, etc.). See `middleware/scripts/build-vnsee-ferrari.sh`.

## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, [reMarkable AS](https://remarkable.com/).\
**I hold no responsibility for any damage done to your device as a result of using this software.**

## Install

1) Install xovi and AppLoad on your reMarkable. [Here is a guide.](https://xovi.bearblog.dev)
2) Copy the release for your device into `/home/root/xovi/exthome/appload`.
3) Run `cd xovi/exthome/appload` from the device.
4) Run `unzip vnsee-DEVICE.zip` from the device.
5) Delete the zip archive.
6) Refresh AppLoad.

The VNC server resolution must match your device resolution.

## Technologies

This client was built in C++ using [libvncserver](https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver) and [rm-appload](https://github.com/asivery/rm-appload).
